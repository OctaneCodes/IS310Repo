#What Web Technologies?
HTML was used as the structure of the web page, CSS seems to be used in the layout and design of the page, and JS seems to be used for interactivity. Though all of it seems super chaotic and I dont understand too much about it.
There are some .php files scattered throughout the page that upon a quick google showed they are used for server-sided scripting.

#Who Built the Website?
Brewster Kahle was the original creator of the page back in 1996. It has since then expanded to a much larger team from various professions. 
The about page provides information about key personnel. Github has several smaller open source projects that show contributors such as:
